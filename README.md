Distance Routing Effect Algorithm for Mobility:

The objective of the project is to implement a new routing protocol for ad-hoc networks that is built around two novel observations: one called the distance effect and the other called node's mobility rate. The proposed directional algorithm sends messages in the recorded direction of the destination node, guaranteeing delivery by following the direction with a given probability. In addition, the algorithm is fully distributed, provides loop-free paths, and is robust, since it supplies multiple routes.
